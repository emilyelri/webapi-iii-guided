# Middleware Notes

## Jargon

Separation of Concerns.

_we do NOT write code for the computer, code is a communication device, _

**EVERYTHING IS MIDDLEWARE!!**

Well, almost everything :-)

## Types `(based on how we got it or who built it)`

- built-in: included with express. ex: `express.json()`
- third party: must be installed from `npm`
- custom: we code these!!
